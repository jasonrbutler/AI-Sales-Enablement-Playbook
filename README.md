## 💎 Core Methodology: The "Revenue Technologist"
Modern sales leadership requires more than relationship management; it requires the ability to architect automated systems that drive pipeline velocity and precision.

### 1. High-Precision Prospecting (The Clay/LLM Stack)
Instead of manual research, I leverage AI-driven enrichment to identify "Trigger Events" (e.g., a prospect's company launching a new product or an executive interview).
* **Workflow:** Clay + Perplexity API + Anthropic (Claude 3.5)
* **Result:** Hyper-personalized outreach at scale that references specific 10-K risk factors or recent podcast insights.

### 2. Intelligent Discovery (Gong + Bedrock Orchestration)
Post-call analysis shouldn't be manual. I use LLM orchestration to synthesize discovery calls directly into actionable GTM assets.
* **Workflow:** Gong Transcripts -> AWS Bedrock -> Custom Sales Memo
* **Output:** Automated "Value Maps" that align customer pain points directly with product features for immediate C-suite delivery.

### 3. Partner-Led Velocity (Ecosystem Orchestration)
Scaling through partners requires real-time feedback loops. I build automated "Enablement Bridges" to ensure partners have the right assets at the right time.
* **Workflow:** n8n -> Salesforce -> Slack / Partner Portal
* **Impact:** Reduced partner friction and $1.5M+ in sourced revenue through automated co-selling motions.
